Look at the classical tower of hanoi problem and its solution in the below link:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/analyzing-the-algorithm-to-solve-the-tower-of-hanoi-problem-686685f032e3/


Write a Python program to solve the problem using breadth-first search.
Inputs to the program should be
1. Number of disc
2. Initial rod where disc are present
3. Initial arrangement, i.e., decreasing or increasing order
4. Final rod where disc will be shifted
5. Final arrangement, i.e., decreasing or increasing order


Intermediate output shall be properly displayed. For example, you can find a sample in this link:
https://www.includehelp.com/ml-ai/water-jug-problem-in-artificial-intelligence.aspx
This intermediate output shall be written in an output file.

Things to upload:
1. Downloaded colab .ipynb files
2. Output files
3. Small write-up on the process used to solve the problem.
