Look at the Travelling Salesman Problem and its solution of finding the shortest possible route from a particular given start city.
Write a Python program to solve the problem using Iterative optimization methods (an Optimal Configuration Search).
Choose any suitable heuristic function and execute it in the problem.
Provide necessary inputs to the program. Do not statically mention any of them inside the program.

Intermediate output shall be properly displayed and will be written in a separate output file. 

Things to upload:

1. Downloaded colab .ipynb files
2. Input file
3. Output files
4. Small write-up on the process used to solve the problem.
