Summary:
For this assignment, I developed a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human can play against the computer. The AI uses the alpha-beta pruning technique to optimize its moves, making the game more challenging and efficient.




Key Features Added:
* Implemented alpha-beta pruning for the computer’s decision-making.
* Added difficulty levels: easy (random moves), medium (blocks player wins), and hard (uses alpha-beta pruning).
* Allowed the user to choose whether to play first or second.


Main Functions Used:
* print_b(): Displays the current state of the board.
* win(): Checks if a player has won.
* full(): Checks if the board is full.
* score(): Evaluates the board for the AI.
* ab(): Performs alpha-beta pruning to select the best move.
* easy_move(), medium_move(), hard_move(): Select moves based on the chosen difficulty.
* main(): Handles the game loop, user input, and overall flow.


Important Variables:
* b: Represents the game board as a 2D list.
* user, ai: Symbols for the human and computer players.
* diff: Stores the selected difficulty level.
* turn: Tracks whose turn it is.


Additional Details:
The game logs each move and the final result to a text file for record-keeping.
The code is structured for clarity and simplicity, with short variable and function names.


Conclusion: This implementation demonstrates the use of search algorithms in game AI and provides a user-friendly interface with adjustable difficulty.
