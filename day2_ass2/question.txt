a. Write a Python program to load
and read one categorical data from a CSV file.

b. Convert it into a transactional format using
their attribute-value pair. Give a numerical value for each attribute value
pair. After that make a binary dataset from the categorical format where the
numbers given to each attribute value pair represent a column name.

c. Draw the corresponding graph considering the
binary dataset as the value present in it.

d. Run the single pair shortest path problem and draw the path on the
graph.
