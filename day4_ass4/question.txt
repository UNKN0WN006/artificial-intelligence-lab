Look at the
classical 8-puzzle problem and its solution from a particular given
start state to a specific end state.



Write a Python program to solve the problem
using Depth-Limited Search in such a way that it can handle the 15-Puzzle
problem with the same program.

Provide necessary inputs to the program. Do not
statically mention any of them inside the program.

Input and output states shall be written in the
same file and you can read them properly as required.

Intermediate output shall be properly displayed
and will be written in a separate output file.



Things to upload:

1. Downloaded colab .ipynb files

2. Input file

3. Output files

4. Small write-up on the process used to solve
the problem.
